The Makefile in the parent directory contains recipes for building
and installing documentation and for installing the various startup
files.

The file jove.rc is intended to be 'source'd before each run of jove
(except when the -J flag is given).  This file contains various
initializations, some of which are pretty well essential and some of which
are suggestions for sysadmins to experiment with.  See the comments in
this file.  Note that if you hack this file, you must take precautions to
avoid your changes being lost if you upgrade Jove.  See jove-local.rc
and /etc/jove/jove.rc below for alternatives for performing local
customizations that should not be lost on new installs.

jem.txt is a simple startup help window that is displayed (from jove.rc)
if (on Un*x systems) the user does not have a.joverc file. It can also be
suppressed by setting the environment JOVENOHELP=1 (useful for non-Un*x).
 
A files jove.rc.$TERM, where $TERM is the value of the TERM environment
variable, is 'source'd near the end the generic jove.rc, and provides
suggested bindings for the function keys on the various terminals.  The
selection of terminals given is somewhat arcane, and suggestions for
bindings for other terminals would be welcomed.  See the comments in these
files.

After jove.rc.$TERM is source'd, a file jove-local.rc is source'd if it
exists.  Local settings can be placed in this file that will add to or
override previous settings from jove.rc and/or jove.rc.TERM files.
jove-local.rc may contain terminal bindings but is not terminal specific;
if a site does a lot of terminal key binding customization for multiple
terminal types, it should likely create a local terminal file and source
it from this file (see jove.rc for an example of how to do this).
Finally, if a file called /etc/jove/jove.rc is found, it is sourced.
That file is expected to contain per-host or per-distro settings.

The user's $HOME/.joverc will be 'source'd after jove.rc.$TERM and
jove-local.rc .  User preferences belong in this file.

The files keychart.TERM, where TERM is the value of the $TERM environment
variable, are intended to display a map of the Function Keys on the
particular keyboard showing what they are bound to.  This file will be
displayed when the user gives the 'keychart' macro (which should usually
be bound to the Help key, if there is one).  The file 'keychart.' is a
dummy for unrecognized $TERMs.  Some of these files also contain setup
information for the terminal.

We welcome contributions to our collection of terminal support files.
We don't have the resources to create more than a few ourselves.
