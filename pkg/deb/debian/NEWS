jove (4.17.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Beginning with Version 4.17.x we drop the automatic recover of crashed
    jove sessions.

    This means that your crashed sessions are kept in /var/tmp and will not
    moved on reboot to /var/lib/jove/recover. You can still recover crashed
    files with 'jove -r'.

    You should clean /var/lib/jove/recover from remains of old sessions.

    If you want to keep the old behaviour, you need to reinstall the init.d
    script. It is in /usr/share/doc/jove. Don't forget to
    'update-rc.d jove start 20 2 3 4 5 .'
    You also need to set /var/lib/jove/recover to 1777.
