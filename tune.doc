Here's a list of the compile time options and what they mean.  All options
are turned ON in the distributed version of Jove.

ABBREV		Enables word-abbrev-mode which again is nice for paper writers.

BACKUPFILES	This enables backing up files on write.  I guess lots of
		people like this feature.  It enables the feature but you
		can still control whether files are backed up with the
		make-backup-files variable.

BIFF		This enables turning on and off BIFF so your screen doesn't
		get messed up with messages from BIFF.

CMT_FMT		This enables code to format and indent C comments.

F_COMPLETION	Enables filename completion.  This requires that your
		system have reasonable directory scanning capabilities.
		It's a really handy feature, so it's worth turning on.

ID_CHAR		Enables support for Insert/Delete character on terminals
		that have those capabilities.  Couple of problems with this
		code:  it's large, takes up lots of I space which is a
		problem for the smaller computers (pdp11).  Also, it isn't
		particularly smart and sometimes does really stupid things.
		It sometimes uses insert/delete character when simply
		redrawing would have been faster.  And if you look at code
		you'll understand why I don't like it all that much.

IPROCS		Nice feature which lets you run interactive UNIX commands in
		windows.  In particular, there is a shell command built in
		which starts up an interactive shell in a window.  Porting
		this one is hard even within Unix systems -- non-Unix systems
		may not want to even try supporting this.

LISP		Enables Lisp Mode.  This includes code to indent "properly"
		for Lisp code and new routines to move over s-expressions.
		You probably won't want (or need) this on PDP-11's.

RECOVER		Enables code to support recovery of data from crashed JOVE
		sessions.

SPELL		Enables the spell-buffer and parse-spelling-errors commands.
		They are nice especially if you have lots of paper writers.
		Requires SUBSHELL (to run spell program).

SUBSHELL 	Enables various uses of sub-shells (eg. push-shell,
		filter-region, shell-command-to-buffer, compile-it,
		spell-buffer, ...) Somewhat easier to port than IPROCS.
		If SUBSHELL is not defined, jove -r (for recovery) will
		not work.
