JOVE on UNIX Systems
--------------------

For information about other systems, see the other READMEs.


Quick Summary of Installation
-----------------------------

Configuration is not automatic, but it is simple for modern systems.
Usually only SYSDEFS is critical and this can be specified in the make
command line.

Unpack the tar file somewhere convenient and cd into it:
tar tzf jove*.tgz

BSD:
  use the first of the following that works:
  make SYSDEFS="-DBSDPOSIX_STDC -DUSE_OPENPTY" EXTRALIBS=-lutil install
  make SYSDEFS="-DBSDPOSIX_STDC -DUSE_OPENPTY -DHAS_LIBUTILS_H" EXTRALIBS=-lutil install
  make SYSDEFS="-DBSDPOSIX_STDC" install
  make SYSDEFS="-DBSDPOSIX" install

LINUX:
  make SYSDEFS="-DSYSVR4 -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500" install
  If this fails because the system doesn't have -ltermcap, try:
  make SYSDEFS="-DSYSVR4 -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500" TERMCAPLIB=-lncurses install
  To build RPMs on Red Hat LINUX: rpmbuild -ta jove*.tgz

Solaris:
  make SYSDEFS="-DSYSVR4" install

Other systems:
  Read comments about SYSDEFS settings in Makefile

Some systems have dropped the termcap library.  The curses (or
ncurses) library is much fatter than termcap, but will do.
If ld complains that there is no -ltermcap, add TERMCAPLIB=-lcurses.
If ld then complains that there is no -lcurses, try TERMCAPLIB=-lncurses.

When in doubt, read the rest of this document.

Please help us keep up with new systems.  If your system isn't covered
here on in the SYSDEFS section of Makefile, tell us what works.  If
your system is covered, but the documented procedure doesn't work,
tell us.


Full Story of Installation
--------------------------

JOVE does not use any automatic configuring mechanism.  Most
configuring is done by editing definitions in Makefile (in some
situations it is handier to override definitions by supplying them on
the make command line).

JOVE has been around for a long time, and a lot of care has been taken
to make it work on many systems, new and old.  For current systems,
less configuring is require -- hurray for standards!

Makefile specifies paths for installing JOVE components (JOVEHOME,
SHAREDIR, LIBDIR, BINDIR, MANDIR, MANEXT), tempfiles (TMPDIR, RECDIR),
and the default shell (DFLTSHELL).  Although the defaults are
reasonable, you may wish to change them.

For many systems, you will need to change the definition of SYSDEFS.
to the symbol that identifies your system's characteristics, using the
notation for a macro-setting flag to the C compiler.  For example, on
a Sun running SunOS 4.0, use "SYSDEFS=-DSUNOS40".  The Makefile
describes suitable settings of SYSDEFS for many configurations.  If
yours isn't mentioned, use "grep System: sysdep.h" to find all
currently supported system configurations.  If there is no canned
configuration for your system, you will have to define a new symbol
and edit sysdep.h suitably.  See "sysdep.doc" for the possible set of
system-dependent aspects that you can select/tune.

On some systems, you may need to change the flags passed to the
compiler (OPTFLAGS) or the linker (TERMCAPLIB, EXTRALIBS, LDFLAGS).

Next you may edit "tune.h" to select the compile time features you care
about.  See "tune.doc" for a description of all the compile time options.
The default options are quite reasonable so, in most cases, you should
leave them alone.  If you are really short on space, or are porting JOVE
to a new system, you may want to define -DBAREBONES in SYSDEFS to avoid
some of the less-portable features of JOVE initially.

You can type "make" to compile "jjove", "portsrv" (this is compiled on
every system, but is only used if JOVE is compiled with the PIPEPROCS
feature selection, typically on UNIX systems without pseudo ttys),
"recover" and "teachjove".  Test jjove to see if it works (remember that it
won't be able to access its subsidiary files until they are installed, so
you will need to call it with "./jjove -l . -s doc ..." -- assuming you are
in the main JOVE directory).  If it works, type "make install" to install
everything where it belongs.

Here are some things to consider when choosing a definition for
TMPDIR, the directory where JOVE puts temporary files.  The obvious
place is /tmp, but many systems delete all files in /tmp when they are
rebooting.  If you hope to recover buffers from a system crash, TMPDIR
lets you specify a safer place.  If your system does not remove
subdirectories of /tmp on reboot (lots do remove them these days) then
it makes sense to make TMPDIR be /tmp/jove; otherwise, /var/tmp may be
better.  But if you use /tmp and want to recover buffers on system
crashes, you should put the lines:
	(echo preserving JOVE files)	>/dev/console
	(cd /tmp; /usr/local/lib/jovelib/recover -syscrash) >/dev/console
in the /etc/rc file BEFORE /tmp is cleared, so that you can recover
files after reboots (hint: look for the equivalent code to preserve vi
tempfiles).  You should then create a crontab entry to clear out old files
in /usr/preserve.

If you plan on using JOVE with a xterm, look at doc/XTermresource.
This file contains resource declarations that allow JOVE to respond to
more function keys and mouse gestures.

For the pdp11 version there is the Ovmakefile.  This has only been
tested on 2.9bsd, and not recently.  It worked pretty well, actually,
and it was possible to turn on all the compile time options with this
version.

For LINUX, jove.spec is provided to specify how an RPM should be created.
On Red Hat LINUX 7.x, 8.0, and 9, "rpmbuild -ta jove*.tgz" will build
source and binary RPMs -- rpm looks inside the .tgz to find jove.spec.


Some features.
--------------

"doc/jove.rc" and "doc/example.rc" are JOVE initialization files.  "jove.rc"
is the recommended "system" rc file (until you are ready to roll your own,
that is).  It gets read every time JOVE starts up FOR EVERYONE ("make
install" should copy it to the right place automatically).  After that
JOVE reads the initialization file .joverc in the user's home directory.
"example.rc" is my personal .joverc.

The files intro.nr and cmds.nr in the doc directory are the official JOVE
manual.  I got permission from Richard Stallman to use his manual for the
original EMACS, modifying it where necessary for JOVE.  Lots of work was
done by Brian Harvey on this manual.

There are man pages for jove and teachjove.  Teachjove is for people who
have never used EMACS style editors.  It is an interactive tutorial, THE
tutorial written by Stallman for the original EMACS, only slightly
modified for JOVE in the appropriate places.  The man pages are
completely up to date, thanks to me.

Changes since 4.16
------------------

- Portability fixes.  Most important: work around a never-to-be-fixed
  bug in ncurses (the freely redistributable termcap/terminfo
  database).

- Various minor bug fixes.  Highlights:
  + use mkstemp to avoid a security loophole
  + avoid bad interaction between metakey and xterm mouse support
    in windows wider than 95 characters
  + handle symlinks better
  + obscure bug in text justification that could hang JOVE
  + misuse of stat that only misbehaved on LINUX

Changes since 4.16beta
----------------------

- Added the variable paragraph-delimiter-pattern to customize paragraph
  recognition.

- Ported to Win 32 (but not Win 32s)

- Several variables have been renamed to more clearly indicate their function.
  The old name will still work, but eventually it will be eliminated.
	allow-bad-filenames => allow-bad-characters-in-filenames
	display-bad-filenames => display-filenames-with-bad-extensions
	internal-tabstop => tab-width

- Several minor bugs fixed.  Several portability improvements.
  + MSDOS: avoid date rollover problem
  + Borland C: support version 4
  + Borland and Microsoft C: enable HIGHLIGHTING
  + NetBSD: dodge ssize_t redefinition
  + SCO UNIX: use <ctype.h>
  + SunOS + Solaris: make charp effective
  + generic: Ensure screen is maintained during non-interactive processes,
    even if the user has typed ahead

- The xterm mousing interface has been completely revamped.
  Some small ancillary consequences of this are
  + A next-line (prev-line) landing in the middle of a Tab selects the Tab
    character (rather than the following one)
  + A yank-pop is no longer permitted to follow a copy-region.

Changes since version 4.14.6.
-----------------------------

JOVE now works on many newer systems.  For example, it compiles
under Solaris 2.n (SYSDEFS=-DSYSVR4).

The uninstalled binary in the JOVE directory is jjove instead of xjove
(xjove is now something else).

The new command line flag -J inhibits the reading of the global
jove.rc file.  Similarly, -j inhibits ~/.joverc.

JOVE's auxiliary files are kept in two directories (actually, they can be
the same directory).  The sharedir holds the system jove.rc and cmds.doc,
the data used to implement the describe-command and describe-variable
commands; these files are meant to be machine-independent.  The libdir
holds portsrv and recover; these are compiled programs, and are
machine-dependent.

There are three ways JOVE uses to determine each of the directories, two
of them new.  If JOVE was invoked with -l dirname, dirname is taken as
the LibDir; otherwise, if the environment contains JOVELIB, its value is
taken as the LibDir; otherwise, the value of the make variable $(LIBDIR)
when JOVE was compiled is used as LibDir.  Similarly, -s dirname,
JOVESHARE, and $(SHAREDIR) specify ShareDir.  As a shortcut, -ls dirname
specifies both directories.  Now, a good way to test an uninstalled
version of JOVE is to say, within the JOVE directory,
	jjove -s doc -l . other_parameters

A new command "pushlibd" effectively does a pushd command with ShareDir as
the operand.  This is for use within startup files such as jove.rc.

The global startup file is now in doc/jove.rc (was doc/system.rc), so the
-s flag can find it as above.  It contains lots of goodies (you might not
want all of them), including an ability to call up additional TERMinal
specific startup files depending on the $TERM environment variable.
Among other things, these provide support for the many wacky keys that
terminal makers provide.  See doc/README.

The old make-keymap and bind-keymap-to-key commands are no longer needed.
Instead, bind-to-key can accept character strings of any length (they had
better not be a prefix of any other binding).  This enables, among other
things, binding commands to the function keys on Sun keyboards.  Buffer-
specific bindings are now supported (local-bind-* commands).

All system dependencies are now gathered together in the file sysdep.h, to
make it easier to select the bits of code which should or should not be
included for various flavors of UNIX.

The position of the mark is now indicated by underlining it (the position of
point is, of course, indicated by the cursor, so the extent of the region is
now easily seen).  The bad news is that, although this works well on
terminals, underlining is broken in some environments (notably SunView
and the versions of OpenWindows with SUNOS4.1.x and Solaris 2.0 -- Solaris
2.1+ is OK).  For the broken OpenWindows versions, you can include the
following in your .Xdefaults file
	term.boldStyle:				Offset_X_and_Y
	term.underlineStyle:			Same_as_Bold
The stock X11 terminfo entry for xterm was broken until X11R6 in a way that
will cause the screen to be scrambled when JOVE tries to use underlining.
The following fixes to the entry solve this problem and more:
	replace "blink=@," with "blink@,"
	replace "rs2=@" with "rs2@," [note the added comma!]
	add "kf1=\EOP," [if not already be present]
	delete "smul@,"	and "rmul@," [if present]
	add "smul=\E[4m, rmul=\E[m," [xterm does support underlining]

The portion of the buffer visible in the window is now indicated by
"uninverting" a part of the modeline in proportion.  This feature is really
intended for use with "xjove" (described next), and there is a variable
"scroll-bar" to enable it.

xjove is a complete front-end for JOVE which will be found in the directory
xjove (see the README there).  It enables setting of point and mark with the
mouse, cutting and pasting of text via the region, and scrolling by pointing
into the modeline.  It is written using the XView library (supplied with
Suns, or with the X-distribution from MIT); there is also a version for
Sunview known as jovetool.  See its man entry in doc/xjove.nr.

An alternative way of using the mouse is provided in the form of commands
designed to recognize the mouse events coded by Xterm.  These facilities
are not nearly as extensive or convenient as those provided via xjove or
jovetool.

Within SHELL windows, the TERM environment variable is now set to "emacs",
mainly to discourage running programs which might have depended on something
else.  Some shells (tcsh, for example) have specific provisions for the emacs
terminal type.

By default, commands requiring a "y" or "n" response require a Return as
well.  When variable "one-key-confirmation" is set "on", a single
character "y" or "n" is expected.

Some features have been removed.  Marks always float, so the variable
"marks-should-float" is gone.  The IBMPC-specific commands scroll-*-page
are gone.

JOVE is now 8-bit clean (the old behavior can be retained by setting NCHARS
to 128 in sysdep.h, but no known system requires this setting).  In operating
systems with the necessary support (USE_CTYPE set in sysdep.h) it is
possible to set the environment variable LC_CTYPE (or the JOVE variable
lc-ctype) to a "locale" such as "iso_8859_1", whereupon characters with the
8th bit set sent from the keyboard (using the Alt Graph key, or the Compose
key, or the Meta key, or whatever the particular hardware provides) will be
displayed correctly, and will be treated as upper/lower case, etc in the
correct manner.  The default locale is "C", which reverts to 7-bit ASCII with
the top 128 characters being displayed in octal.

The format of the "jrec" file has changed.  This means that previous
versions of recover cannot deal with the files left by crashes of the new
JOVE, and vice versa.

Here is a list of reasons why your .joverc might no longer work.  JOVE
places diagnostics about the user and system .joverc files in the buffer
"RC errors".

- JOVE no longer ignores extra stuff on the end of binding commands.

- All keymap creation is implicit.  You no longer can or need to create
  new keymaps explicitly.

- auto-execute-command no longer magically supplies a numeric argument
  for its command.  If the command is intended to set a mode, you should
  supply the argument.  If you don't set the numeric argument, the mode
  will be flipped.  Here is an example from the system jove.rc:
	1 auto-execute-command c-mode .*\.[chy]$

- Within regular expressions, alternatives are separated by "\|".
  Previously, alternatives within braces were separated by ",".
  For example, "/tmp/\{Re,article,rnmail,pn\}" must be changed to
  "/tmp/\{Re\|article\|rnmail\|pn\}".

- auto-execute-command and auto-execute-macro both require explicit
  patterns.  Previously, the pattern would default to match every filename.

- Certain commands and variables have been eliminated or renamed:

	bind-keymap-to-key, make-keymap, process-bind-keymap-to-key --
		no longer needed
	unbind-key -- bind the "unbound" command instead
	marks-should-float -- they always do now
	physical-tabstop -- now picked up from termcap
	scroll-next-page, scroll-previous-page -- IBM PC only, and useless
	background-color => background-attribute -- IBM PC only
	foreground-color => foreground-attribute
	mode-line-color => mode-line-attribute

- On the IBM PC, the Delete key now generates the ASCII DEL character;
  Control-@ and Control-Space now generate the ASCII NUL character.


Known problems
--------------

In an interactive process buffer, JOVE sometimes fails to receive an
end-of-file through the pseudo-tty.  In this case, the process window
will not be considered done, even though the child and all its
ancestors are dead.  The only consequences are that the status
display continues to report that the process is not done and that
another process may not be started up in that buffer.  This only
happens on certain systems, and we think that they are at fault.

If a window-find command is issued while the current window's lines
are numbered, the numbering may become wrong temporarily.  We are
working on this bug.

JOVE can not handle lines longer than JBUFSIZ characters (usually 1024,
but 512 on some small systems).  Eliminating this limit is not easy.

JOVE can not handle NUL characters in the buffer.  In most cases,
they are discarded silently, another dubious feature.


Bug Reports and Maintenance.
----------------------------

Although Jonathan Payne still takes a fatherly interest in JOVE and retains
overall control, the hassle of day-to-day bug-fixing, sifting of new
features, and maintenance of general cleanliness is now co-ordinated by Hugh
Redelmeier (hugh@mimosa.com).

The mailing list jovehacks@cs.toronto.edu forwards mail to the group of
people who develop and maintain JOVE.  We welcome submissions to
jovehacks, for example:

- queries and suggestions about support for additional systems

- bug reports (we may already have an explanation or fix)

- suggestions for and implementations of improvements or additional
  features (we do try to keep JOVE small)
